# Welcome
Hello everyone! Welcome to my github page. My name is Mohammadkia Zamiri.  

In my github page, I put code in C language and have uploaded python exercises. In the near future, I will also upload CUDA C 
codes and programs for people who are interested in Parallel Processing like me. I hope that my codes will be useful for you.
